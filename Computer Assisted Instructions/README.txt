Computer Assisted Instruction 
As computer costs decline, it becomes feasible for every student, regardless of economic circumstance, to have a computer and use it in school. This creates exciting possibilities for improving the educational experience of all students worldwide as suggested by the next five exercises. 
The use of computers in education is referred to as computer-assisted instruction (CAI). This program will help an elementary school student learn multiplication. The program prompts the user with a question.
The student then inputs the answer. Next, the program checks the student’s answer. If it’s correct, display the message "Very good!" and ask another multiplication question. If the answer is wrong, display the message "No. Please try again." and let the student try the same question repeatedly until the student finally gets it right.
Monitoring Student Performance: More sophisticated computer-assisted instruction systems monitor the student’s performance over a period of time. The decision to begin a new topic is often based on the student’s success with previous topics. It counts the number of correct and incorrect responses typed by the student. After the student types 10 answers, program calculate the percentage that are correct. If the percentage is lower than 75%, display "Please ask your teacher for extra help.", then reset the program so another student can try it. If the percentage is 75% or higher, display "Congratulations, you are ready to go to the next level!", then reset the program so another student can try it.

Program allows the user to enter a difficulty level. 
At a difficulty level of 1, the program should use only single-digit numbers in the problems; at a difficulty level of 2, numbers as large as two digits, and so on. 

Program allows the user to pick a type of arithmetic problem to study. 
An option of 1 means addition problems only, 2 means subtraction problems only, 3 means multiplication problems only and 4 means a random mixture of all these types.
