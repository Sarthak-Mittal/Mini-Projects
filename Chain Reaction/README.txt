A strategy game for 2 players.

The objective of Chain Reaction is to take control of the board by eliminating your opponent's digits.

Players take it in turns to place their digits in a cell. Once a cell has reached critical mass(i.e. 4 or 8 here)
their digits explode into the surrounding cells adding an
extra digit and claiming the cell for the player.

A player may only place their digit in a blank cell or a cell that contains digit of their own colour.
As soon as a player looses all their digits they are out of the game.

Each player have their own predefined digits already.

player 1:
	1 - for showing minimum mass of cell.
	2 - intermediate level of mass in cell.
	3 - cell on verge of bursting because of being unstable.
	4 - BOOM!! explodes, adjacent cells are given a mass of 1 each.

Similar things are done for player 2 by digits 5,6,7,8 respectively.

I hope you have as much fun playing this as I have coding it.
